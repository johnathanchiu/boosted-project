# Boost Project

A replication of the pairing protocol between a boosted board and remote. My current board version is v1.5.2 and remote is v2.3.3.

# Setup

To get started I recommend following these resources to get setup with ESP-IDF BLE library:
1. https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/
2. https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf

I set up my development environment through VSCode:
