# Boosted Project

!!!THIS REPO IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS!!

A replication of the pairing protocol between a boosted board and remote. My current board version is v1.5.2 and remote is v2.3.3.

I wrote down all the boosted board/remote services and characteristics on this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1elPj-vNOmTOq7oeU73JZj5jzti-n7vpdX68a-TypZo0/edit?usp=sharing

# Setup

To get started I recommend following these resources to get setup with ESP-IDF BLE library:
1. https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/

I set up my development environment through VSCode:
